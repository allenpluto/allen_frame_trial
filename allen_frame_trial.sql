This completes the process of restoration of your roof prior to coating.\n \nAs part of the final step your roof is sterilised, sealed and membrane coated to your selected colour, providing a permanent finish that will withstand all weather conditions.\n\nRepairs and Rebedding\nOver time the bedding cement that holds ridge capping in place becomes brittle and needs to be replaced. This happens through exposure to the natural elements, small shifts in the housing structure, and the growth of plants, such as weeds and moss, within the small cracks of the bedding cement. When the bedding cement is dislodged gaps are exposed and water can enter the roof cavity. In addition the pieces of dislodged roof bedding cement can end up in the gutters and may cause blocked gutters and blocked downpipes. The process of rebedding and pointing the ridge capping is needed to ensure the roof is waterproof protecting the internal contents of the house from water damage.\n\nContact us for further details.', 'A', '{"1":[[0,1]],"2":[[0,1]],"3":[[0,1]],"4":[[0,1]],"5":[[0,1]],"6":[[0,1]],"0":[[0,1]]}', 'https://www.facebook.com/DS-Roofing-pty-ltd-133127380074186/', '', '', '', '', '', 'https://plus.google.com/117833848324935345856/about'),
