As the opener is usually mounted on or close to the ceiling, this required a ladder. To minimise the hassle and improve safety we developed technology that allowed the home owner to code in additional remote transmitters from their existing transmitter, removing the need to touch the opener itself.\nTrio-Code™, the world''s first interference free transmitter system in 2007.\nAxess Pro Series 3000 Industrial Shutter Opener – Released in 2011, Axess 3000 introduced universal operation to allow it to be mounted either on the left or right hand side without any modifications needed, addressing a key issue for the roller shutter industry.\nTri-Code 128™ – Released in 2012, Trio Code 128™ was our most reliable and secure garage door transmitter system ever. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) featured a staggering 309 Trillion, Trillion code combinations to protect against increasingly sophisticated code grabbing devices used by criminals to interfere with remote control systems.\nWireless Safety Beams – Developed to protect your family, possessions and car, safety beams allow the garage door to stop and reverse as soon as an object or person moves through the invisible beam, averting damage or even injury.

William Charles Wentworth and Dr Wardell launched "The Australian" newspaper which was published from No 3 Church Hill in 1833.<br />In 1854 a boarding residence was operated on the site which became known as Wentworth House. In 1882 Mary Hayes purchased Wentworth House and renamed it the Wentworth House Family Hotel. On Christmas Day in 1888, fire destroyed Wentworth House.

The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII and the Duke of Windsor after abdication, danced in the new ballroom on a number of occasions.

In 1961 approval was granted for Qantas to build a new 400 room hotel next to Qantas House in Chifley Square. The new Wentworth Hotel was completed in 1966 and was the first five star hotel in Sydney.
