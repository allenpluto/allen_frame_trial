However, I often feel that through chiropractic therapy I can improve the sense of well being in pets with medical or surgical conditions. It is a similar effect to having a massage or a warm bath when we are feeling off colour.\n\nThe chiropractic philosophy basically says that because all cells and tissues in the body (with the possible exception of blood cells) are in contact with nerve fibres and through them the central nervous system (the spinal chord and the brain), if the nervous system is disrupted the target organs and cells may also dysfunction.\n\nNerves carry messages from the brain to target organs, and conversely from organs to the brain.\nThose nerves must pass through small canals between the vertebrae. When the spine moves the vertebrae massage the nerves and that helps to keep them in a healthy state. If two vertebrae become locked the nerve passing between them is poorly massaged and messages can be obstructed. Then the brain and target cells may fail to communicate.\n\nFrom head to pelvis there are about 143 joints in the spine. Chiropractic treatments aim to optimise nervous activity by eliminating situations which compromise movement of any one of the joints in the spinal column.\n\nSometimes health practitioners become very involved in ongoing cases and it can be difficult "to see the wood from the trees".Then an alternative opinion is often helpful.\n\nSometimes a chiropractor can resolve an unresponsive medical problem and sometimes a conventional medical practitioner will resolve an unresponsive chiropractic problem. When this happens it is not that one is right and one is wrong it is just that by changing the perspective of examination and knowledge another light shines upon the problem.\n\nDr David Lindsay offers a comprehensive range of veterinary and pet health-related services, including:\n\n• Animal Chiropractic\n• Surgery\n• Desexing\n• Specialists referral \n• Dentistry\n\nand more', 'A', '{"1":[[0.3541666667,0.75]],"2":[[0.3541666667,0.75]],"3":[[0.3541666667,0.75]],"4":[[0.3541666667,0.75]],"5":[[0.3541666667,0.75]]}', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''),

RSL Members decided by national ballot that membership should be restricted to those who had served overseas. Legion membership was open to all Ex-Service personnel regardless of their place of service. It was the Legion, which acquired the Club premises in Armidale. The building was largely derelict and known as the “old steam laundry”.\n\nIn 1953, the Armidale Ex-Services Memorial Club was founded at a public meeting of Ex-Servicemen attended by about 150 people. On July 18, 1953, members of the Legion Branch decided to transfer the premises to the newly formed Club. However, it was not until January 1953 that the actual transfer of the premises’ title was effected. At the Annual General Meeting of 1953, the Club had a total of 153 persons.\n\nThe premises were well over 100 years old and had operated as Richardson’s Flour Mill, a skating rink, a dance palais and a laundry. The Club also had a large debt to pay and was only able to carry on through guarantors and credit from business houses.\n\nThe Club traded for several years without a liquor licence until 1955 when the first liquor licence was granted and extensions were made to the Club. Further extensions and renovations occurred in 1958, 1960, 1963, 1972, 1979, 1996,  2008 – 2010 and most recently 2015. The Club now offers the Mill Bistro for our members dining pleasure, a multi-purpose Auditorium (seating capacity 800), a variety of Meeting and Function Rooms, Sports Lounge with full TAB and Keno facilities plus two Snooker tables & Dartboards, Main Lounge with weekly Raffles, Members Draw & Promotions plus a Coffee Lounge.\n\nThe Club also provides men and women bowls facilities and a synthetic bowling green.

Membership numbers increased. Ladies nights were introduced. More entertainment and sporting facilities were added. In fact, by 1963, the Club was beginning to outgrow its home.\n\nArchitects were called in to investigate expansion of the Club’s building. However, it was discovered that the foundations could support a second storey – and adjacent land was deemed too expensive.\n\nBy 1965, Glen Innes & District Services Club had bought two properties at the corner of Grey and Lang Streets and construction started on a new, larger clubhouse.\nAlso in 1965, the Club introduced afternoon entertainment and free dinner for the town’s old aged pensioners every 3 months. This was a big hit and by 1970, 200 pensioners were being entertained each quarter.\n\nGlen Innes & District Services Club has now been a part of Glen Innes life for 47 years.

The president of the then RSL Sub-Branch in Temora chaired the meeting with 17 members present. That day it was moved and passed that the Club reform and the first committee was formed.\n\nIn December of 1956, a liquor license was finally obtained and the Club’s committee arranged to borrow six Poker Machines from another club in Wagga Wagga, just in time for Christmas.

Consequently a meeting was held at the Yanco Hall on Thursday, 3rd January, 1946. It was moved by Mac Waring & seconded by W. Jones that a club be formed to be known as Yanco All Servicemen''s Club.\n\nThe Club as it stands today occupies the original site which was a garage owned by Tom MacPharland. MacPharland sold the garage to the club after the club had leased the garage for two years for the sum of 400 pounds.\nTwo Years later the club was extended by purchasing an army hut that had been used as an army post office in Narrandera during the war.\n \nLater as membership increases the hut was demolished and concrete walls erected.  The roof was extended the full length of the land as it is today.  In 1958 the building was modernised and extended with the foundation stone being laid by then governor of NSW Sir John Northcott.  The building was officially opened by Colonel Ramsey. In 1963 after the Club decided to accept women as associate members, a second storey was added to the club building which incorporated a ladies lounge, auditorium and a dining room.\n\nDining Room\nIt''s the finest dining in town, you will find our venue the perfect atmosphere whatever the occasion.

The quota was easily reached and on October 29, 1959 the Queensland Cricketers’ Club was launched.\n\nToday’s stunning premises on level three of the northern stand have housed the Club ever since.

Apart from the areas grazed, the country around contains mallee, rosewood and belah woodland and contrasts with the closer settled Victorian side of the Murray River.\n\nThe Bend, on the Murrumbidgee River, has shady parking and a swimming spot with picnic tables, boat launching ramps and toilets.  The main recreation ground in town, Greenham Park in We Street, caters for football, soccer, cricket, rugby, hockey, basketball, netball, tennis and horse-racing with many of these organisations receiving assistance in one form or another from the Club.

They enthusiastically invested their savings to ensure their club became a reality and many local people donated their time and resources to help build the first green and clubhouse.\n\nFrom the time of the opening of the first green in 1957 the popularity of Tuncurry Bowling Club grew steadily. Over the years the club experienced a regular increase in members and visitors and became a successful and profitable club, able to provide a range of amenities and social activities for its members. As its finances were secured by the growth in income, the committee confidently embarked on a number of improvements and extensions to the club.\n\nSince its formation, the primary purpose of the Tuncurry Bowling Club was to promote the game of bowls. From the beginning the members took their sport very seriously and set out to be competitive with other clubs in the area, regularly entering and winning Pennants in the district. Over the years the club achieved many local honours and had a number of champion bowlers in its ranks.\n\nTuncurry Bowling Club now has over 8,000 social and bowling members, a large modern club house and three greens.

The course is a hidden jewel, and was selected for the 2010 NSW Amateur Medal, as only the second course outside the Sydney Metropolitan area since 1974. It is home to many giant tallowoods, a dense native gum which was sought after by early settlers for heavy hardwood suited to maritime and industrial uses. Our many trees are home to a koala population, protected by the foresight of the club’s founders in 1940, when they proclaimed in our constitution that we should protect and nurture them as part of the club’s raison d’etre. We have done this as best we could, but encroaching development has made the task more difficult.  Injured and sick koalas are often released here by professional carers, as a sanctuary situation is available to them here.\n\nThe vegetation is mature, with very little ‘impossible’ rough, and just a few water carries. Our course may be a little shorter than some, but it makes up for that in its subtle demand for accuracy.\n\nAs a tribute to the koalas and their dwindling numbers, we recently commissioned renowned Gloucester chainsaw artist Geoff Hitchcock to create our ‘Giant Koala’, fashioned from the remaining trunk of a blackbutt tree next to the (brand new August 2014) sixth green, which had become dangerous to players. You will note from what you see around our course and clubhouse that the koala has been the club’s emblem and mascot for more than 74 years at the time of writing.\n\nWe have a seven day Bistro and Restaurant, with pleasant views over the course and beyond for our patrons. Our auditorium is suited to weddings, parties or similar functions for up to 200 persons, with smaller functions also catered in dining facilities and/or al fresco. We operate gaming, racing and eftpos facilities, and our friendly staff are always keen to please.\n\nAccess to the course is via Kangaroo Street and Walker Crescent, and a little off the beaten track for our visitors.  The GPS might come in handy. If you don’t have one, simply look for the communications tower on the highest hill (not the one next to Woolies in town) and weave your way towards it. Golfing and Social Memberships are very affordable, with direct debit and time payment facilities popular.\n\n', 'A', '{"1":[[0.2708333333,0.9166666667]],"2":[[0.2708333333,0.9166666667]],"3":[[0.2708333333,0.9166666667]],"4":[[0.2708333333,0.9166666667]],"5":[[0.2708333333,0.9791666667]],"6":[[0.2291666667,0.9791666667]],"0":[[0.25,0.9166666667]]}', 'https://www.facebook.com/Muree-Golf-Club-Raymond-Terrace-192399684161676/', '', '', '', '', '', 'https://plus.google.com/102799530478310648286/about'),

Old citizens have recollections of the game being played in 1906, but first printed references to be found are in 1911.\n\nThe course first played followed the foreshores from the Munster Street end of the camping reserve to the site of the cottages now situated east of Pacific Drive above the cliffs, thence westward to near Owen Street and then northward to Burrawan Street in the south-western corner of the portion of Oxley Park now occupied by the High School.\n\nGradually over the years it became almost entirely contained in Oxley Park. This area, with more people playing, and with crossed fairways, became dangerous to players and public, and in 1948 a search was begun to find a more suitable area. Finally, Mr. J. Scott, course architect, responsible for the design of Elanora, was commissioned to choose from the sites offering and to submit a plan. He chose the present site and work began in 1951.\n\nIn July 1953, Port Macquarie Golf Club moved to the new course but because of the necessity to maintain the old course for play, very little progress had been made on the new area. Members, however, elected to play under rugged conditions for a time in order that reasonable progress could be made.\n\nPlay was first over six holes, progressing fairly quickly to eleven holes. At this point course extensions were delayed for a few years because of the need for a more suitable clubhouse. That having been achieved, the southern extension was next brought into play. Work was finally completed to a sufficient degree to bring the full 18 holes into play in April 1967, and the official opening was pronounced in February 1968, by president of the New South Wales Gold Association, Mr Les Graham.', 'A', '{"1":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"2":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"3":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"4":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"5":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"6":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]],"0":[[0.4166666667,0.9166666667]]}', 'https://www.facebook.com/PortMacquarieGolfClub/', 'https://twitter.com/PortGolf_Club', '', '', '', '', 'https://plus.google.com/102924040557961556445/about'),

Boat storage was then becoming a problem. In 1950 we decided to build a club shed at the foot of Macquarie Street. With the help of our bank which advanced us $600.00, we built the shed with voluntary labour. This clubhouse, when completed, served as our home for eight years. \n\nIn 1957 our increasing fleet numbers and membership indicated that again we would have to do something regarding a larger clubhouse. In 1958, after receiving a Conditional Club Licence and a loan from our bank, plus the sale of debentures, we commissioned our builder to go ahead and build the first section of the brick building that we occupy today. The building was completed in December 1958. \n\nBy 1962 it was obvious that further additions would be necessary in the near future. Planning and building commenced and they were officially opened on 8 November 1968 by Mr Bill Northam. \n\nAt this time it would be fitting, not to forget the great debt of gratitude the members of this Club owe to those early founders in 1945-46, who worked hard and willingly to make this Club what it is today, and especially we owe a great deal to the Ladies Auxiliary formed in those early days, who have been a tower of strength to the Club over the years.
