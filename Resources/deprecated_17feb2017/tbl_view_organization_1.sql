However, I often feel that through chiropractic therapy I can improve the sense of well being in pets with medical or surgical conditions. It is a similar effect to having a massage or a warm bath when we are feeling off colour.\n\nThe chiropractic philosophy basically says that because all cells and tissues in the body (with the possible exception of blood cells) are in contact with nerve fibres and through them the central nervous system (the spinal chord and the brain), if the nervous system is disrupted the target organs and cells may also dysfunction.\n\nNerves carry messages from the brain to target organs, and conversely from organs to the brain.\nThose nerves must pass through small canals between the vertebrae. When the spine moves the vertebrae massage the nerves and that helps to keep them in a healthy state. If two vertebrae become locked the nerve passing between them is poorly massaged and messages can be obstructed. Then the brain and target cells may fail to communicate.\n\nFrom head to pelvis there are about 143 joints in the spine. Chiropractic treatments aim to optimise nervous activity by eliminating situations which compromise movement of any one of the joints in the spinal column.\n\nSometimes health practitioners become very involved in ongoing cases and it can be difficult "to see the wood from the trees".Then an alternative opinion is often helpful.\n\nSometimes a chiropractor can resolve an unresponsive medical problem and sometimes a conventional medical practitioner will resolve an unresponsive chiropractic problem. When this happens it is not that one is right and one is wrong it is just that by changing the perspective of examination and knowledge another light shines upon the problem.\n\nDr David Lindsay offers a comprehensive range of veterinary and pet health-related services, including:\n\n• Animal Chiropractic\n• Surgery\n• Desexing\n• Specialists referral \n• Dentistry\n\nand more', 'Shop 9', '170 Main Rd', 'Blackwood', 'SA', '5051', 2091, '100', 0),

Kerry would watch the local baker kneading, stretching and shaping dough, before putting it in the oven where it was transformed into golden loaves. He didn’t know it yet, but that experience would be the beginning of Sonoma Bakery Cafe.\n\nYears later, on a whim, Kerry leased the old bakery for $1,000 per year and restored it with his sons Andrew and Christian. It was 1997 and none of them had ever baked a loaf before, all they knew was that they wanted to make beautiful, wood fired bread.\n\nToday, the much loved Sonoma Bakery Cafe brand is synonymous with excellence. A dad and his two sons who knew nothing about bread took on the challenge and with years of hard work, undying passion and unyielding determination, they’ve created Australia’s most respected artisan sourdough bakery.\n\nEvery loaf of Sonoma sourdough contains organic flour, filtered water, sourdough starter and sea salt.

Jones that a club be formed to be known as Yanco All Servicemen''s Club.\n\nThe Club as it stands today occupies the original site which was a garage owned by Tom MacPharland. MacPharland sold the garage to the club after the club had leased the garage for two years for the sum of 400 pounds.\nTwo Years later the club was extended by purchasing an army hut that had been used as an army post office in Narrandera during the war.\n \nLater as membership increases the hut was demolished and concrete walls erected.  The roof was extended the full length of the land as it is today.  In 1958 the building was modernised and extended with the foundation stone being laid by then governor of NSW Sir John Northcott.  The building was officially opened by Colonel Ramsey. In 1963 after the Club decided to accept women as associate members, a second storey was added to the club building which incorporated a ladies lounge, auditorium and a dining room.\n\nDining Room\nIt''s the finest dining in town, you will find our venue the perfect atmosphere whatever the occasion.

Those original foundation committee members could not have foreseen the development that was to occur in the ensuing fifty odd years to the wonderful club it is today.  Many extensions, alterations and improvements have been carried out by the Directors over the years since the official opening such as a modern ladies lounge opened in 1969 (now a cozy coffee lounge & seating area), a bowling green in 1973, and a club auditorium in 1975  just to name a few.\n\nOnce considered the end of the line, Balranald now is a stopping place on the Sturt Highway, that forms the direct link between Sydney and Adelaide.  Many travellers find the town ideal for an overnight (or longer) stay to refresh themselves at the Club with a magnificent meal, refreshing drinks and just a great place to unwind in and enjoy the many facilities on offer at the local Club.\n\nFirst settled in the 1840s on the site of a fording place of the Murrumbidgee River Balranald gained importance during the river-boat days as a service port for the wool industry.\n\nBalranald and the Club now services the surrounding grain, sheep, cattle and viticulture industries. Apart from the areas grazed, the country around contains mallee, rosewood and belah woodland and contrasts with the closer settled Victorian side of the Murray River.\n\nThe Bend, on the Murrumbidgee River, has shady parking and a swimming spot with picnic tables, boat launching ramps and toilets.  The main recreation ground in town, Greenham Park in We Street, caters for football, soccer, cricket, rugby, hockey, basketball, netball, tennis and horse-racing with many of these organisations receiving assistance in one form or another from the Club.   Adjacent to this ground is a three-pool swimming complex and golf course.

As its finances were secured by the growth in income, the committee confidently embarked on a number of improvements and extensions to the club.\n\nSince its formation, the primary purpose of the Tuncurry Bowling Club was to promote the game of bowls. From the beginning the members took their sport very seriously and set out to be competitive with other clubs in the area, regularly entering and winning Pennants in the district. Over the years the club achieved many local honours and had a number of champion bowlers in its ranks.\n\nTuncurry Bowling Club now has over 8,000 social and bowling members, a large modern club house and three greens.

Unfortunately, as sufficient water could not be found the project fell through and the sum of £600, which had been collected from local residents to form the Club, had to be returned. As Mr Baker left the district in 1920 and as local residents were still very keen to fulfil what Mr Baker initiated, local real estate agent Mr William Ross Souter was asked to carry on the project. Eventually in 1924, a good supply of fresh water was found in sufficient quantities to sustain a green.

The course is a hidden jewel, and was selected for the 2010 NSW Amateur Medal, as only the second course outside the Sydney Metropolitan area since 1974. It is home to many giant tallowoods, a dense native gum which was sought after by early settlers for heavy hardwood suited to maritime and industrial uses. Our many trees are home to a koala population, protected by the foresight of the club’s founders in 1940, when they proclaimed in our constitution that we should protect and nurture them as part of the club’s raison d’etre. We have done this as best we could, but encroaching development has made the task more difficult.  Injured and sick koalas are often released here by professional carers, as a sanctuary situation is available to them here.\n\nThe vegetation is mature, with very little ‘impossible’ rough, and just a few water carries. Our course may be a little shorter than some, but it makes up for that in its subtle demand for accuracy.\n\nAs a tribute to the koalas and their dwindling numbers, we recently commissioned renowned Gloucester chainsaw artist Geoff Hitchcock to create our ‘Giant Koala’, fashioned from the remaining trunk of a blackbutt tree next to the (brand new August 2014) sixth green, which had become dangerous to players. You will note from what you see around our course and clubhouse that the koala has been the club’s emblem and mascot for more than 74 years at the time of writing.\n\nWe have a seven day Bistro and Restaurant, with pleasant views over the course and beyond for our patrons. Our auditorium is suited to weddings, parties or similar functions for up to 200 persons, with smaller functions also catered in dining facilities and/or al fresco. We operate gaming, racing and eftpos facilities, and our friendly staff are always keen to please.\n\nAccess to the course is via Kangaroo Street and Walker Crescent, and a little off the beaten track for our visitors.  The GPS might come in handy. If you don’t have one, simply look for the communications tower on the highest hill (not the one next to Woolies in town) and weave your way towards it. Golfing and Social Memberships are very affordable, with direct debit and time payment facilities popular.\n\n', '', '7 Walker Cres', 'Raymond Terrace', 'NSW', '2324', 1064, '160', 0),

This area, with more people playing, and with crossed fairways, became dangerous to players and public, and in 1948 a search was begun to find a more suitable area. Finally, Mr. J. Scott, course architect, responsible for the design of Elanora, was commissioned to choose from the sites offering and to submit a plan.

Members, however, elected to play under rugged conditions for a time in order that reasonable progress could be made.\n\nPlay was first over six holes, progressing fairly quickly to eleven holes. At this point course extensions were delayed for a few years because of the need for a more suitable clubhouse. That having been achieved, the southern extension was next brought into play. Work was finally completed to a sufficient degree to bring the full 18 holes into play in April 1967, and the official opening was pronounced in February 1968, by president of the New South Wales Gold Association, Mr Les Graham.', '', 'LOT 4 Ocean Dr', 'Port Macquarie', 'NSW', '2444', 734, '160', 0),

Boat storage was then becoming a problem. In 1950 we decided to build a club shed at the foot of Macquarie Street. With the help of our bank which advanced us $600.00, we built the shed with voluntary labour. This clubhouse, when completed, served as our home for eight years. \n\nIn 1957 our increasing fleet numbers and membership indicated that again we would have to do something regarding a larger clubhouse. In 1958, after receiving a Conditional Club Licence and a loan from our bank, plus the sale of debentures, we commissioned our builder to go ahead and build the first section of the brick building that we occupy today. The building was completed in December 1958. \n\nBy 1962 it was obvious that further additions would be necessary in the near future. Planning and building commenced and they were officially opened on 8 November 1968 by Mr Bill Northam. \n\nAt this time it would be fitting, not to forget the great debt of gratitude the members of this Club owe to those early founders in 1945-46, who worked hard and willingly to make this Club what it is today, and especially we owe a great deal to the Ladies Auxiliary formed in those early days, who have been a tower of strength to the Club over the years.

The board recognise:\n\n•  Importance of directors and staff collaborating to take a hands-on role at community events\n•  A strong link between healthy, outdoor activity and good civic behaviour in young people\n•  Importance of establishing a recognised and branded partnership between community events and the club\n•  Capitalising on the club’s unique location and\n•  Taking an entrepreneurial approach to community events.\n \nMembers and guests enjoy spectacular views in comfort and safety. The club boasts a lift, new furniture, contemporary interior design and a choice of 24 beers on tap and a range of premium wines and cocktails. Since the club has completed a number of refurbishments since 2010, membership has swelled to over 10,000 people. \n \nWhat club members appreciate most, however, are the wonderful smiles and top-notch customer service from a talented team of managers and staff.

Six holes were located on what is now Lion’s Park, along the banks of the Macintyre River.\n \nIn May 1907, the Inverell Golf Club was founded, with election of the first office bearers. A shed was erected to serve as a Clubhouse, and was originally located close to the present entry gates of Lion’s Park. The shed was subsequently removed to ‘Ryan’s Paddock’, the current location of the Golf Course. The actual shed is still in use, and forms part of the Greenkeeper’s workshop.\n\nThe official opening of the new Course took place on 29th August 1925. Records indicate that the Inverell Golf Club had a membership of 90 at that time. The original site was already generally clear of excess trees and roughage, and Members soon proceeded to clean excess grass, add sand to the Greens, formed bunkers and Tees, and from there the game progressed.\n \nIn 1927 the Inverell Golf Club made application to the Lands Department for permission to lease part of the current Top Nine, totaling 95 acres. It was soon decided that the leased lands were not sufficient for a full nine holes, and negotiations were entered with the Pastures Protection Board and Bannockburn Shire for the acquisition of a further 21 acres, being the current 7th, 8th, 9th holes, as well as the present Clubhouse site. This acquisition, for 80 pounds, was subject to a Contract of Sale dated 13/12/28 and a Transfer of Land dated 11/6/36. During this time, Members and Contractors went about clearing the land, which was heavily timbered and contained huge stone masses.', '', '4078 Bundarra Rd', 'Inverell', 'NSW', '2360', 2958, '160', 0),

Two quite different examples epitimise this community spirit - each Wednesday morning the club runs therapy bowls for the disabled and together with our green keeper we have installed a number of large rainwater tanks allowing us to be largely water self sufficient for the maintenance of our greens.\n \nThe club also has initiatives in place to encourage younger bowlers, with an arrangement with a local high school, for bowls to be a school sport and a local primary school is also a regular user of the greens.', '', '1479 Pacific Hwy', 'Warrawee', 'NSW', '2074', 2829, '160', 0),

The hull shape of the skiff changed dramatically and materials development was at a peak. Trevor Beardsmore became two-time Australian Champion in his skiff “Minx”. In 1979 the skiff measurement went metric with only the name remaining imperial.\n\nHowever the change of decade bought a change in fortunes. As the Government overturned club advantages within licensing and gaming laws, Middle Harbour Skiff Club struggled. Costs were cut concurrently with the reduction in skiff crew numbers down to three. With characteristic guts, flexibility and labour from the members, all nature of enterprise were run to keep the club afloat, before hitting on the idea to restructure and sub-lease the function area; a relationship lasting twenty years with the famous "Fresh Ketch Restaurant" was forged.\n\nDuring the nineties the skiff became friendlier to sail. Boats were decked-in, the number of rigs was reduced, Highfield levers to bend the rig became a thing of the past as “ballooners” or asymmetric spinnakers and fixed poles, proven in speed and efficiency took their place.\n\nSkiff sailing at Middle Harbour goes from strength to strength, four years ago the 13 foot skiff was introduced to bridge the gap from junior sailing, lost when the fourth hand “bailer boy” position on a skiff was cut. The club has had two Australian 13 foot skiff Champions; Dan Watterson (www.sheads.com.au) and Scott Cotton (Northside Sailing School) as well as another 16 foot champion, Lee Knapton (Bob Jane T-Marts Edgecliff). However, social evolution marches on curtailing "Boat races" with "Booze buses" and introducing a whole new alphabet from "X"-box to "E". Once again the forecast changes but the skiffies tack again into the new breeze - a lift! A $4 M renovation and new catering agreement with Zest Waterfront Venues, is in place to take the club sailing through to 2034.\n\nWith the famous names of past champions; Beardsmore, Beashel and O’Rourke still ringing in the ears, a third generation of skiffing "Hendry''s” and a strong, growing junior fleet in the wings, another chapter in the exciting life of Middle Harbour Skiff Club opens and we hope that the brave -spirited, community-focused, egalitarian mate-ship of Middle Harbour’s 16 foot skiffies prevails long into the future.', '', '237 Spit Rd', 'Mosman', 'NSW', '2088', 3974, '160', 0),
